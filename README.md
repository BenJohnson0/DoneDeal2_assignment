Web Development & Deployment assignment, which requires us to "Develop a web application that interacts
with a Mongo database via Node.JS and that includes an authentication mechanism. 
The application must implement the 4 CRUD operations (Create/Read/Update/Delete) at least once."

# Assignment Description
Our website is based on buying and selling cars. Users can create an account, which is stored in a MongoDB collection,
login and view their "favourite" cars, once authenticated. if users are not logged in, they can only browse the Register, Buy and Sell pages.
On the Buy and Sell pages, users can search and filter various type of cars. On the Account page, users can change their profile picture, password and personal details.
Build using Javascript, React, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, Cors, jquery and Bootstrap.

# Instructions for use
Upon cloning the repo, 
- cd into the server directory and run "npm install" 
- cd into the client directory and run "npm install"
- cd into server again, and run "node server"
- cd into client, and run "npm start"
- View the website on localhost/3000

All user details are stored in the MongoDB collection, so this must be running before the app is started.
